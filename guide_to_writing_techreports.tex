\section{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}
Most of the writing done by engineers consists of reports and papers
meant to transfer information to the reader.  Different readers will
have different requirements from a report or a paper.  A managing
director will probably not have time to read the report but will be
interested in the most important results and recommendations.
Somebody paging through a technical journal needs to establish quickly
whether a paper is important.  Once this has been determined, the
reader may be interested in checking the information in the finest
detail: What was done?  How was it done?  What was it done with?

The most important problems experienced by technical writers are
concerned with the structure (format) of their writing and with
meeting the demands of accuracy, brevity and clarity.

This guideline aims to prescribe a rigid structure for writing
technical reports and papers and to assist the writer by detailing the
exact requirements of the different sections of a report/paper.  The
guidelines are formal requirements of the Department of Chemical
Engineering for all reports, from practical training reports to PhD
theses.  For detailed information about postgraduate studies,
please refer to~\citet{buys}, which is available on-line from
\url{http://www.ais.up.ac.za/ebit/guides/research_guide.pdf}.  Note
that the department's style guidelines still apply.

The writer should make use of good judgement to link the style and
structure prescribed by this guide to areas not covered by the guide.
This means that the written work should form a cohesive whole even
when not directly prescribed.

\section{Format}
\label{cha:format}
Papers and reports typically consist of editorial information, the
introduction, the body of the report, (under headings such as theory,
literature, experimental, results and discussion) conclusions,
recommendations and a reference section.  If necessary, and only if
necessary, appendices are added.

Typical basic outlines for reports and papers are shown in
Tables~\ref{tab:reportformat} and \ref{tab:paperformat} respectively.
For details of actual requirements, refer to
Chapter~\ref{cha:structure} of this guide.

In a major report it is customary to start every section (Results,
Recommendations, etc) on a new page, except if the sections are less than one page long.\bigskip

Note that it is not always possible to follow the prescribed format for reports and papers (for instance, there may be no specific apparatus).  
At such times one must invent one's own main and sub-headings to suit the work done.  
The hierarchy of headings and flow of argument then becomes very important.

\end{boxedminipage}

In a paper every section is not necessarily started on a new page.
Conserve space as much as possible.
\end{table}

\subsection{Font and spacing}
A font that is large enough to remain legible after being reduced in
size (for instance, when printing two pages per page) should be used.
A font size similar to Arial 12 or Times New Roman 14 is the minimum
size that will be accepted.  Garamond 14, CG Times 13 and Courier New
12 are examples of acceptable fonts and sizes.  Please compare the
font size of the type of font in which you prefer to work with these
guidelines, keeping in mind that different fonts may appear
differently sized even when they have the same point size selected in
a word processor -- refer to appendix~A1.3 of
\citet{bruckmanmandersloot}, especially the table on page 186.

As an example, consider the following two lines where fonts are
compared with the same

\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\textbullet~``M'' height 
& {\fontsize{4mm}{11pt}\usefont{T1}{phv}{m}{n} M Arial }
& {\fontsize{4.3mm}{11pt}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n} M Times } 
& {\fontsize{5mm}{11pt}\usefont{T1}{pcr}{m}{n} M Courier } 
& {\fontsize{4.2mm}{11pt}\usefont{T1}{ppl}{m}{n} M Palatino } \\\
textbullet~``x'' height 
& {\fontsize{4mm}{5mm}\usefont{T1}{phv}{m}{n} x Arial}
& {\fontsize{4.6mm}{5mm}\usefont{T1}{ptm}{m}{n} x Times} 
& {\fontsize{4.6mm}{5mm}\usefont{T1}{pcr}{m}{n} x Courier} 
& {\fontsize{4.6mm}{5mm}\usefont{T1}{ppl}{m}{n} x Palatino} 
\end{tabular}\\

A line spacing of $1\frac{1}{2}$ (specified in the 
paragraph format section of the word processing program) is prescribed
with double that spacing between paragraphs.  
This spacing makes it easy to write comments on the report.

Use Appendix~\ref{sec:app-font-spacing} to check your choice of font
size and spacing.

% TODO: Add some discussion of the reasons behind font choices.

% Stack Overflow
% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/340923/what-is-the-most-readable-appealing-font
% 

\subsection{Math}
Mathematical symbols are treated as shown in the following example:
% TODO: We should really have a reference for this style - maybe AMS?

The height $h$ was measured as a function of time $t$.  The relationship between $h$ and $t$ was found to be 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:commaexample}
  h(t) = h_0 - \lambda t
\end{equation}
where $h_0$ is the initial height and $\lambda$ is an experimentally
determined constant.  It was also determined that the velocity
$\mathbf{v}$ was a function of the position $\mathbf{x}$ given by
$f(\mathbf{v}) = \beta \mathbf{x} + \sin(\alpha)$ and that in general
$h_{\mathrm{max}} \leq 5$ m.

Dynamic analysis showed that the system could be represented by
Equation~\ref{eq:matexample}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:matexample}
  G(s) = \frac{1}{s+1}\left [ 
    \begin{array}{cc} 
      3 & \log{b} \\ 
      2 & \num{1.1} 
    \end{array} \right ]
\end{equation}

Therefore, the model was revised to
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = 5t + g(t) \qquad \frac{\mathrm{d} g}{\mathrm{d} t} = t + f(t) \qquad A = \int_a^b f(t) \mathrm{d} t
\end{equation}

Finally, it was determined that
\begin{equation}
  s = \sin\left \{ \arctan \left [  5 +  \sqrt{x + \cos\left(\frac{\beta}{1+\beta} + \pi\right)} \right ] \right \}
\end{equation}

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Scalar variables ($h$, $t$, $s$) are \emph{italicised} lower case.
\item Vector variables ($\mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{x}$) are \textbf{bold}
  lower case, but not italicised.
\item Matrix variables ($G$) are upper case and \emph{italicised}.
  Matrices are shown in Equation~\ref{eq:matexample}, with block
  brackets.
\item Standard mathematical functions ($\sin(\alpha)$, $\log b$) and
  numeric constants are not italicised.
\item Numbered equations are centred, with the number in brackets on
  right margin (see~Appendix~\ref{sec:tips-equations}).
\item A font similar to the body text font should be used, so when
  using a sans-serif font like Arial, the formulae should be
  sans-serif as well.
\item Differential equations are stated using the correct partial
  derivative symbol $\partial$ (not a lowercase delta $\delta$) for
  partial derivatives and upright ``d''s  for total derivatives.
\item Integrals are stated using upright ``d''s
\item Deeply nested equations can use different brackets in the
  sequence \{[()]\}.
\item An equation can be seen as a clause and should scan as a part of
  the sentence.  However, associated punctuation should be implied
  rather than expressed.  In Equation~\ref{eq:commaexample}, there is
  an implied comma after the equation, while in
  Equation~\ref{eq:matexample} there is an implied period.
\item Note the difference between the mathematical operators for subtraction $-$ and multiplication $\times$ and the en dash - and the letter x. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Chemistry}
Use the IUPAC naming convention for compounds where possible unless
there is a commonly used name (like acetone instead of
dimethylketone).  Favour using names in the text unless they are
inordinately long, when the abbreviation can be used after initially
stating the full name.  Compound names should be cased normally
(starting with upper case at the start of a sentence, and lowercase
otherwise).

More information on naming conventions can be retrieved from the IUPAC
website (\url{http://www.iupac.org}).  Where unusual compounds are being used, it is often advisable to list their CAS numbers or INChI codes to make it easier for others to find compound information.

The correct symbols should be used for chemical reactions,
particularly in reversible reactions like
\begin{displaymath}
  \mathrm{A} + 2\mathrm{B} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{AB}_2
\end{displaymath}

\subsection{Numbers and units}
Numbers are shown with a either a decimal comma \emph{or} a decimal point, spaces between thousands and
$\times 10^x$ notation rather than computer notation
(\num{12345.12345e-12}).  See~Appendix~\ref{app:computerproblems}.

SI units should be favoured except where conversion would be
uncomfortable (refer to a \SI{20}{psi} pressure limit rather than
\SI{137.895}{\kilo\pascal}).
Use standard
SI prefixes instead of scientific notation unless a large variation in
numbers occurs (use \SI{1}{\nano\meter} instead of \SI{1e-9}{\meter}).

For more information on the use of SI units see the BIPM website at \url{http://www.bipm.org/en/si}.  You are advised to download and study the SI booklet available from this URL, but a few pertinent points are summarised here.

Units should always be upright to differentiate them from variables ($h = \SI{1}{\meter}$).  
Always leave a space between a number and its
unit, but ensure that the unit and the number are on the same line
(see Appendix~\ref{sec:tips-formatting}).  Celsius temperature is
often incorrectly shown as 120\si{\celsius}, but should also be spaced
as in \SI{2.4}{\celsius}.  The SI treats \% as a unit, so it should also be preceded by a space: \SI{2.1}{\%}.

To ensure that m (meter) is not confused with m (\num{1e-3} prefix) multiplication of units should always be indicated with a space or a raised center dot($\cdot$).
Note the difference between \SI{10}{ms^{-1}} (10 reciprocal milliseconds) and \SI{10}{m.s^{-1}} (10 meters per second).

Another common error occurs with units like 
%TODO: Convert using \SI[per-mode=fraction] - not currently supported
\num{4.2}~$\frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2\cdot\mathrm{K}}$.  
This should be written as \SI{4.2}{W/(m^2.K)} or
\SI{4.2}{W.m^{-2}.K^{-1}} 
%TODO: Should we put this in?:
%or (to save a little space at the cost of legibility) \SI{4.2}{Wm^{-2}K^{-1}}
but \emph{not} as \SI{4.2}{W/m^2K} or \SI{4.2}{W/m^2/K}.  
Both of these last forms are ambiguous and can therefore lead to misunderstanding.

Note that SI allows the use of l or L for litre, but not $\ell$.
If there is a risk of confusing l (lower case ell) with 1 (one) or I (upper case i) in the font you are using, use L.

Remember to \emph{be consistent} when you have made an optional choice like using L or using a dot instead of a space for multiplication.

\subsection{Date and time}
Dates and times should conform to ISO standard 8601~\citep{isodates}.
In summary, dates are written as YYYY-MM-DD (year, month, day) and times as hh:mm:ss (hours, minutes, seconds).  
When both are used together, the date comes first, leading to a set of numbers where the significance of each group of digits is strictly descending.
Smaller numbers may be left off in each group, so 2010-04 (for April 2010) or 09:15 (for quarter past 9) are acceptable.

\subsection{Figures}
Figures are included in the text with no border, and a suitable center-justified caption is displayed below the figure as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:figexample}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[xlabel=Time / s, 
                 ylabel=Height / m, 
                 ylabel style={rotate=-90, anchor=east},
                 domain=0:10,
                 ymin=0,ymax=110,
                 enlargelimits=false]

      \addplot+[only marks] expression {100 - x^2 + rand*10};
      \addlegendentry{Experimental};
      \addplot[solid] expression {100 - x^2};
      \addplot[dashed] expression {110 - 10*x};
      \addlegendentry{Model A};
      \addlegendentry{Model B};
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Example of a figure.  Note that the line types are easy to
    distinguish without a colour display.  }
  \label{fig:figexample}
\end{figure}

Use similar fonts (both size and lettertype) in the figure as in the
main text and always ensure that the caption explains the figure in
more detail than ``A plot of height over time'' -- this is visible from the
graph.  Note the advice in Appendix~\ref{app:computerproblems}.

Figures containing photographs should be processed to be legible in
black and white, including labels.

\subsubsection*{Dos and don'ts}
Do
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that the fonts on your picture are the same size and type as
  the main text.
\item Use linetypes that are distinguishable in black and white
  reproductions
\item Use suitable axes for showing the information you need to be seen
  (logarithmic for exponential behaviour, etc)
\item Use suitable orders of fits if fitting.
\item Show error bars indicating uncertainty.
\item Include detail in the caption (about number of experiments,
  variance)
\item Use the caption to tell the reader what to look for in the graph/picture.
\end{itemize}

Don't
\begin{itemize}
\item Fit splines (smooth curves) through all the data points
\item Graph data that can fit into a small table (typically, use the
  representation that takes less space).
\item Use ``computerisms'' like degC instead of \si{\celsius}\ or 1.2e2
  instead of \num{1.2e2} 
\item Connect discrete experimental results with lines or connect data when there are not enough to suppose interpolation holds
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tables}
Avoid vertical lines in tables as much as possible (even on the sides
of tables -- tables are not ``boxed in'').  The vertical
lines of figures should be enough to guide the eye vertically.  A
slightly thicker line should be used at the top and bottom of the
table, with a thin line between the headings and the data, as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:tabexample}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption{Example of a table (adapted from \citet{fear})}
  \label{tab:tabexample}
  \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{centering}
      \begin{tabular}{@{}llr@{}} \toprule 
        \multicolumn{2}{c}{Item} \\ \cmidrule(r){1-2} 
        Animal & Description & Price\textsuperscript{a} (R)\\ \midrule 
        Gnat & per gram & \num{13.65} \\ 
        & each & \num{0.01} \\ 
        Parrot\textsuperscript{b} & stuffed & \num{92.50} \\ 
        Emu & stuffed & \num{33.33} \\ 
        Armadillo & frozen & \num{8.99} \\ \bottomrule 
      \end{tabular} \\
    \end{centering} 
    \vspace{1em}
    \textsuperscript{a} As of 2004 \\
    \textsuperscript{b} Norwegian blue only
  \end{minipage}
\end{table}

Units should be specified in the heading of a column and longer descriptions included as footnotes below the table.
Never split a figure or a table across two pages.
If more space is required than a single page, it is usually a sign that the material should be split into separate tables.

\subsection{Cross-referencing}
When referring to items in the same text, use capitals and the
correct number as in the following example:

\begin{quote}
  As can be seen from Figures 1, 2 and 4, there is a strong
  correlation between heat transfer and Reynolds number.  Equation 2
  shows the proposed model, while Equation 3 has an alternate
  formulation proposed by Smee (1992).  The experimental results are
  summarised in Table 3.  Section 4 discusses these results in more
  detail, while Section 5 proposes novel research directions.
\end{quote}

Place figures and tables near their first reference (but definitely
after the first reference).  \emph{Each and every sketch, figure and
  table must be referred to in the text.}

\subsection{Abbreviations}
\label{sec:abbreviations}
Our guidelines are adapted from \citet[17]{burger}.  All abbreviations
are written without periods or spaces (New Testament $\rightarrow$
NT).  Abbreviations are written as spoken. Capitals are used when the
single letters are pronounced (CSIR) while normal casing is sometimes used
when they are pronounced as a word (Unisa).  Always defer to the
preference of organisations regarding the spelling of their names
(SAIChE, ECSA).  Try not to use abbreviations unless they are in
common use.  If an abbreviation is not likely to be understood by the
audience, spell it out the first time and introduce the abbreviation
in brackets: South African Institute of Chemical Engineers (SAIChE).

\subsection{Bullets}
\label{sec:bullets}
Bullets are very useful as informal counters (instead of 1, 2, 3 or a, b, c), but guard against bullet overuse.
Do not, for example, bullet every paragraph in a synopsis or introduction.

\section{Structuring the Report/Paper}
\label{cha:structure}

\subsection{Title}
\label{sec:title}
The title is a short, \emph{informative} description of the
investigation.  It must be unambiguous and free of all unnecessary
words, but must contain the important keywords describing the
investigation. Many technical journals limit the title to 15 words.

\citet{mandersloot} offers the following advice:
\begin{itemize}
\item Avoid insignificant words and especially non-specific words like
  Investigation, Studies, Evaluating, Estimation, Method, Treatment,
  Assessment, Modelling, Application etc. In many instances the
  non-specific word can not be eliminated. In such cases do not start
  the title with these words -- use them somewhere else in the title.

\item To maximise impact, start the title with the most significant
  issue -- the Action or (more specific) the Subject of the action.
  For example: ``Optimisation for the design of dividing wall columns''
  is of interest to those who are considering using such a column,
  therefore it calls for a title: ``Dividing wall column optimisation''

\item Constrain the title to the main issues. For example ``Adding
  value to SA raw materials -- selective synthesis of thymol from
  m-cresol over zeolite catalysts'' does not cover raw materials
  (plural) but one only. Mention this side issue in the text, but
  choose a title like ``Selective m-cresol conversion to thymol over
  zeolite catalysts'' or better ``M-cresol to thymol; selective
  conversion over zeolite catalysts''.  The semi-colon (or even the
  colon) is a very useful tool for turning titles around.

  \caption{Report format at a glance}
  \label{fig:reportformatsummary}
\end{figure}

The title of the report and the name(s) of the author(s) appear on the
\emph{cover}. This may be on specially textured paper or simply the
outermost page of the report.  Compare this to a published book.  In
the case of reports written for a specific university course (like CPY
311 or CLB 321) the course code and the hand-in date is displayed at
the bottom right hand corner of the cover.  Laboratory reports and
similar documents would normally not require a cover -- the first page
is then the title page.

The first page is the title page on which the title and the author's
name again appear, as well as additional information like the name of
the institution, company or authority under whose name the report is
published and the date.  For university reports the student's number
and the course name and code will be given.  In the case of formal
academic dissertations and for some laboratory reports, the university
prescribes the format of the title page.  The information is arranged
intelligently to create a balanced impression.  The cover and title
page are not numbered.

The \subsectionname{synopsis} appears on the very next page, to enable
the cursory reader to find out immediately what the main findings and
recommendations (if any) are.  Because the synopsis is always read
together with the title, the title is repeated.  If a translated
synopsis is given and both do not fit on one page, the translated
synopsis must start on a new page.
\subsectionname{Keywords} appear immediately after
the synopsis.  See~Section~\ref{sec:synopsis-keywords} for detailed
requirements regarding a synopsis and keywords.

If the author wishes to thank persons or other instances, this is done
on the following page under the
heading \subsectionname{Acknowledgement(s)}.

The table of contents is given on the following page under the heading
\subsectionname{Contents}.  Each chapter or section is assigned a number and the number
of the page on which the chapter starts is shown.  The page on which
the introduction starts is page~number~1.  Use a decimal numbering
system for the headings of chapters, paragraphs and sub-paragraphs.
Avoid subdivisions with more than four digits (1.2.3.4.5).  Such
further divisions can be done in the text (but not shown in the table
of contents) with an alphabetical notation. The table of contents does
not include an item ``Contents''.

After the table of contents the nomenclature list is given (in
alphabetical order) under the heading \subsectionname{Nomenclature}.  All
symbols used are defined and the units are given.  Greek
characters, subscripts and superscripts are tabulated separately.
This list is generally only required if several equations are employed
in the text.  The nomenclature list does not include abbreviations,
acronyms etc.

The pages on which the editorial information (synopsis, \dots nomenclature) appears are numbered with small roman numerals (i, ii, \dots).
These pages are also indicated in the table of contents.  The
headings (synopsis, contents, nomenclature etc) of the editorial
information are not numbered.

  \caption{Paper format at a glance}
  \label{fig:paperformatsummary}
\end{figure}

A paper does not have a cover.  The title page should contain the
following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The title in capitals, centred and not underlined.
\item Name/names of author(s), company affiliation(s) and address of
  the author to whom correspondence must be addressed.
\item A heading ``SYNOPSIS'' centred, followed by the synopsis of 100 to
  200 words.
\item A heading ``KEYWORDS:'' at the left margin, followed (on the same
  line) by the keywords (generally no capitals).
\end{itemize}

Nothing else appears on the title page.  The information on the title
page is arranged to form a balanced layout, \emph{limited to one page only}.

The pages are numbered from the title page using ordinary (Arabic)
numerals.  The title page is usually not numbered, so the second page
is number 2.  If a nomenclature list is used, this appears at the top
of page two, followed directly by the introduction.  If the headings
are numbered, number 1 is assigned to
the \subsectionname{Introduction}.  

The remaining sections proceed as for a report.  The theory section of
an article is usually more brief than in a report, as the readership
of the journal will typically be familiar with the subject matter.

\subsection{Synopsis and keywords}
\label{sec:synopsis-keywords}
The synopsis is complementary to the title and is read together with
the title.  All the elements which appear in the title need therefore
not be repeated in the synopsis.  The purpose of the synopsis is to
summarise the
\begin{itemize}
\item scope of the investigation, if necessary
\item main findings and
\item main recommendations (if any).  
\end{itemize}
If the scope is not clear from the title, it can usually be defined
with a one sentence objective statement.  If the purpose of the
investigation is not clear from the title and the main findings, this
is also mentioned.  The synopsis must, however, not contain phrases
like ``An investigation was launched~\dots'', ``\dots~is discussed'' or
``In this report/paper~\dots~is given/discussed/described~\dots''.

Important numerical information must be included in the synopsis.  
If this is negelected, the synopsis will have no impact.
Use paragraphs where appropriate.

Keywords are used in information retrieval systems.  
During a search of this nature papers with a certain keyword or combination of
keywords are selected.  
Choose a maximum of five words to characterise the report, and choose them carefully.  
Keywords should not be too general.

eg KEYWORDS:   small letters, same line

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The purpose of the introduction is to put the reader in the position
where the author was before he/she started the investigation.

The following usually appear in the introduction (but not as seperate sub-headings)
\begin{itemize}
\item Background
\item Problem statement
\item Purpose of the investigation (objective statement)
\item Method (very, very brief) and scope
\end{itemize}

In principle, only enough background should be given to enable the
reader to understand the problem statement.  The problem should be
stated in such a way that the objective can be understood.  It is
sometimes wise to combine the problem and objective statement if the
objective is simply to solve the problem.

In general, the problem statement outlines the justification for the
investigation.  For example: ``The problem is a shortage of potassium
for the manufacture of explosives; the purpose of the investigation
was to determine the feasibility of a filtration technique to purify a
locally available raw material containing potassium.''

The method and scope are mentioned only.  For that no
more than a few sentences will be required.  Further details can be
given in the body of the report.  For example: ``The efficiency is
determined experimentally in a laboratory scale investigation.
Because of compressed air limitations, the investigation is limited to
\SI{300}{\kilo\pascal}.''  or ``The number of swimming pools in the Pretoria
municipal area was determined from aerial photographs.  Indoor pools
are, therefore, not included.''  The scope statement is not a
list of excuses why some things were done badly or not at all.  It is
not a list of shortcomings in apparatus, etc.

\subsection{Theory or literature}
\label{sec:literature}
A chapter on literature is included if more comprehensive background
is required than can conveniently be given in the introduction.  This
background will include information of which the reader is probably
not aware and which is required to understand the report, to justify
the investigation and to follow arguments and mathematical models or
expositions.  A review of \emph{relevant} literature \emph{must} be
given in all project reports, laboratory investigations and
dissertations.

It is totally undesirable to rewrite major portions of something like a
laboratory guide or textbooks, or to give detailed derivations of
equations.  Show only a summary of the current state of the art.
Referencing must be used to indicate the source of each statement or
data and each equation or derivation used in the literature chapter.

The literature section for a paper will of necessity be less
comprehensive than for a full report.  It should, however, always
convince the reader that the investigation method and the experimental
design were justified and that these were guided by the existing level
of knowledge on the subject.  The literature section should
not be a survey of all the literature published on the topic.  Only
the relevant literature should be discussed.  Never use the heading
Literature ``Survey'' for this section.

\subsection{Experimental}
\label{sec:experimental}
\subsubsection{Reports}

In reports the apparatus, planning and experimental methods are
described in some detail.  These can be included in one paragraph or
each can be assigned a separate paragraph.  The description and/or
references must be complete enough to enable the informed reader to
repeat the experimental work.

\paragraph{Apparatus} 
Describe the apparatus used.  Use sketches and give dimensions if
necessary.  Give equipment type and model number if very specialised
equipment is used.  Do not present the apparatus as a ``shopping
list'', use full sentences.

\paragraph{Planning}
Name the independent variables and justify the choice.  Justify the
range of values investigated for the independent variables used.  Show
and justify the choice of dependent (or measured) variables.  Show the
experimental design.  There are a number of good books on experimental
design, among others one by \citet{hicks}.  Note that
``experimental design'' is not the design or choice of equipment or
the experimental setup.  It concerns the variables in the experiment,
not the hardware.

\paragraph{Methods}
Without using an idiot recipe style, describe the methods used in the
experimental work and analysis.  Use references freely; also
references to standard methods and techniques such as methods of
chemical analysis.

\subsubsection{Papers}
The experimental section in a paper is as brief as possible, but it
must still be informative.  In many cases the three sections
(Apparatus, Planning and Methods) will be combined.  Less detail will
be given and referencing will be generous -- but try not to reference
the full report on which the paper is based.

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:results}
If it is immaterial to logic and flow of argument, report the most
important results first.  Use graphical and tabular presentation
judiciously, favouring graphical presentation.  Do not, in the same
report, show the same data graphically and in tabular form.  Indicate
important points to the reader.  It often makes more sense to report
the results and immediately discuss their significance.  In such
instances change the heading to ``Results and discussion''. The
discussion chapter will then automatically disappear.

In reports, illustrate data manipulation using complete sample
calculations.  If it is feasible (for example in laboratory reports)
sample calculations are placed here, but mostly these are placed
separately in an appendix and referred to here.  In the case of large
projects, make meaningful subdivisions so that results do not
disappear in the variety of data, calculations etc.

\emph{Note:} Generally it is a good idea to subdivide the results section.
Sub-headings assist greatly in providing structure to a report or
paper.

In papers, data manipulation and sample calculations are not generally
shown.  It may at times be necessary to tell the reader (in principle)
how the observed values were manipulated to arrive at the information
presented.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
The results of most technical projects are in the form of correlations
between different variables.  The correlations must be explained using
accepted theories and mechanisms.  In the case of research projects,
new theories or mechanisms must be formulated.

The discussion and interpretation of your results will lead to
conclusions being drawn.  These conclusions should not merely be a
summary of results or observations, but rather show how these results
have been interpreted to form a new statement.

From the viewpoint of the project leader's evaluation, this is a very
important chapter.  It gives an indication of the author's insight
into the problem.

\subsection{Conclusions (findings)}
\label{sec:conclusions}
This chapter is a resum\'e of all the conclusions already drawn in the
discussion chapter.  There will consequently be some repetition.  The
most important conclusions must be mentioned first, unless this leads
to bad logic or loss of argument.  No new material, information or
conclusions may be introduced at this point.

All the objectives of the investigation, as stated in the
\subsectionname{Introduction}, must be addressed here.  All conclusions
mentioned here, must have been discussed beforehand.  All conclusions
must be based on results.

\subsection{Recommendations}
\label{sec:recommendations}

Findings may lead to actions which should be considered.  The
recommended actions are summarised as recommendations.  All
recommendations must be justified or justifiable from the conclusions.
Do not include the word recommendations in the heading if there are no
recommendations to be made.  If the scope of the recommendations does
not justify it, the recommendations can be combined with the
conclusions in one chapter.

\subsection{References}
\label{sec:references}
References should not be confused with headings like ``Bibliography''
or ``Further reading'', which frequently appear in non-technical
reports.  All references must be referred to in the text. Technical
reports and papers do not contain headings like ``Bibliography''.

With the exception of generally known facts, \emph{all statements that are
not your own must be provided with a reference}.  Never create the
impression that ideas, arguments, facts or conclusions are your own
unless this is true.  Plagiarism is a serious academic felony and may lead to disciplinary action, including up to two year's suspension.
Students are often unclear as to what constitutes plagiarism.  A good
rule of thumb is to reference \emph{everything} that you did not
create yourself, \emph{and} any statements that you may have thought
of yourself but may be controversial or counter-intuitive.  At an
undergraduate level it is unlikely that a student will come up with
something that has not been researched before.  If you have not found
supporting references, you have probably not looked hard enough.  For
more information, browse the University's plagiarism site at
\url{http://www.ais.up.ac.za/plagiarism}.

References are typically used to 
\begin{itemize}
\item justify statements and findings
\item enable the reader to consult the original source and
\item acknowledge the author(s) for a specific
  contribution~\citep{burger}.
\end{itemize}

The following statement need not be referenced: `` \dots at
the conclusion of the Second World War in 1945 \dots''

Consult the original source as far as possible, since it will usually
contain the most accurate account of the findings and limitations of a
certain study.  If, however, this is not possible (or if it is not
available) the original source can be cited as follows: ``Paul (quoted
in Strathmann, 1988) found that \dots''.  

Quotes from another person's work must clearly be shown as such, with
reference to the source.  Use ``quotation marks'' (Zeb, 1998) for
short quotes and paragraph indentation for longer ones:

\begin{quote}
  On two occasions I have been asked, `Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put
  into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I
  am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that
  could provoke such a question. (Babbage, 1865)
\end{quote}

In our field of science, direct quotations
are seldom used; exceptions are possibly found in review articles or
in articles with a qualitative or speculative tendency.  When citing
indirectly, only the direct source (the one you read) is included in
the list of references.

See~Appendix~\ref{app:reference_methods} for a detailed discussion on
reference methods.

\subsection{Appendices}
\label{sec:appendices}
\subsubsection{Reports}
The previous chapters form the core of the report.  A good reporter
will arrange them to form a logical overview of the project.  To
achieve this it is usually necessary to exclude raw data, cumbersome
calculations, supporting results (for example standardising of
equipment) and documentary material (for example graphs used in
calculations and computer programmes) from the main body of the
report.  Such material is then put in appendices as appropriate
paragraphs and subparagraphs.

Only one aspect is treated per appendix.  Each appendix is provided
with a number and descriptive heading and is indicated by page number
in the table of contents.  Every appendix must be mentioned in the
text.

Appendices should not contain unedited graphs, tables or figures.  The
symbols and language used in the appendices must be the same as in the
rest of the report.  If computer programmed results are used in
appendices, these must preferably be in the same letter type as the
rest of the report.  Printouts of things like statistical data must be
edited (or retyped) to eliminate unnecessary information and undefined
variables.

It is important to provide the reader with information about the items
in the appendix -- explain why they were included and clear up some of
the more confusing aspects of the items.  An appendix is not a place
to ``dump'' information of only peripheral interest to the reader.

\subsubsection{Papers}
Only in exceptional cases will a paper contain an appendix.  Such an
appendix should preferably not be more than one page and will not
necessarily start on a new page.

\section{Writing technical reports and papers}
\label{cha:writing-reports}

\subsection{Preparation}
Never simply start writing.  Disciplined preparation is
essential~\citep{johnson}.

\subsubsection{Analysis}

Ask yourself certain questions and answer them as well as possible

\begin{itemize}
\item Exactly what information do I wish to convey in this report/paper?
\item What is the most logical order in which I can present this
  information?
\item For which group of readers am I writing?
\item What background information can I assume these readers already
  possess?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Planning}
Plan a comprehensive scheme -- it will serve as your guide for writing.

\begin{itemize}
\item Make as many subdivisions as possible.
\item Determine the hierarchy of headings.  Bear in mind that in any
  scheme material will be separated into divisions and subdivisions
  which, by definition, will be equal to or subordinate to one another
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Writing sequence}
Although the title appears first and after that the synopsis,
keywords, list of symbols, introduction etc, a report/paper is not
written in this sequence.

The \subsectionname{Introduction} is written first.  Give the background,
problem statement, purpose of the investigation and scope of the
investigation (See~Section~\ref{sec:introduction}).  After that the
\subsectionname{Main body} of the report (See~Sections~\ref{sec:literature} to
\ref{sec:discussion} and the \subsectionname{Appendices} (See
section~\ref{sec:appendices}) are completed.

The next important chapter is the \subsectionname{Conclusions and
  recommendations}.  (See~Sections~\ref{sec:conclusions} and
\ref{sec:recommendations}).  The conclusions are already justified in
the main body of the report.  Everything that is stated in the
\subsectionname{Introduction} as an aim/purpose must be addressed in the
conclusions.  It is totally unacceptable to make unsubstantiated
statements in this section.  It is usually necessary to revise, refine
or even rewrite the \subsectionname{Introduction} at this point.

Now that the scope of the report is fixed and the conclusions are
properly formulated, the \subsectionname{Synopsis} is written.  (See
Section~\ref{sec:synopsis-keywords})

The very last job to be done is the formulation of
the \subsectionname{Title}.  Write down a few titles and choose the best
one (See~Section~\ref{sec:title})

\subsection{Editorial care}

\subsubsection{Sentence and paragraph construction}
The so-called fog index can be used to quantify the readability of a
piece of prose.  It is based on sentence length and the use of
multi-syllable words.  The longer the average length of the sentence,
the less readable the report becomes.  Try to keep the average
sentence length under 15 to 20 words.  Use simple explanatory
sentences.  Where long sentences are required, ensure that these are
not confusing.  Avoid vagueness, unnecessary words and words that do
not say exactly what the author means.

A paragraph consists of a number of sentences on a single topic or around a single theme.  
This theme is usually identified early on in the paragraph.
Avoid single-sentence paragraphs.

\subsubsection{Hierarchy of headings}
\label{sec:hierarchy-headings}
The chapters are the most important divisions and are numbered with
single digits.  Further divisions are done in decimal notation.  Make
sure that the numbering reflects the importance of the heading.

If it is elected not to number chapter and paragraph headings, the
hierarchy must be clear from the letter type (capital, bold, lower
case, etc).  Try not to underline headings.

\subsubsection{Notation, graphics, etc}
Study Appendix~\ref{app:computerproblems}.

\section{Editing}
\label{cha:editing}
The process used for editing is used for marking of the student's
report or paper.  It forms the basis of the report editing checklist
given by \citet[176]{bruckmanmandersloot}.  This checklist is adapted
for use as a mark sheet in the Department.  It is the responsibility
of the author to scrutinise and grade his/her report in the same
manner (or to have it done) before it is submitted to the main reader.
A good author will wait a few days after writing the report before
doing this exercise.

Read the \strongemph{introduction} first.  Does it place the
investigation in context, that is does it give background, problem
statement, purpose/aim, limitations and scope of the investigation?
See~Section~\ref{sec:introduction}.  Now read the
\strongemph{conclusions}.  Do the conclusions link directly with the
aims/purpose as set in the introduction?  Are the most important
conclusions offered first?  Is there a reason why not?  Are the
conclusions clear and unambiguous?  See
Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

The reader should now have a good idea of the success of the
investigation.  Page through the report and look at the
\strongemph{headings}.  Is the hierarchy of headings correct, that is do
the numbers or letter type indicate the importance of the heading?  Is
it clear that all the important aspects are included?  See
Section~\ref{sec:hierarchy-headings}.

Now the \strongemph{report} is read in its entirety, starting at the
introduction.  Note the content of each sentence and group of
sentences (text analysis) to ensure that the text appears in the
correct place in the report.  (A trained editor will already have done
text analysis on the introduction and conclusions at the first
reading).

After text analysis one may find that:
\begin{itemize}
\item there are results in the introduction
\item discussion is included in the part of the report that deals with
  experimental work
\item new experimental details are included in the discussion
\item discussion is included in the section that contains conclusions
\item some of the conclusions are not based on results
\item some of the recommendations do not flow from conclusions
\end{itemize}

Also take care to include the following issues:

Judge the author's use of the theory and literature chapter(s).  Is
there a critical analysis of the relevant literature and theory?  Are
the criteria used during the investigation properly identified?  Has a
decent experimental design been done?  See
Section~\ref{sec:experimental}.

Are results properly arrived at and presented?  Are graphical
presentations used efficiently?  Note the significance of data and the
correctness of sample calculations.  See~Section~\ref{sec:results}.
Gauge the author's insight from the discussion, the interpretation of
the results and significance of relationships and correlations.  Is
evaluation done using criteria that are identified in the literature?
Are valid conclusions drawn?  Has new material been introduced in the
conclusions?

The reader should now be well acquainted with the investigation and
can analyse the \strongemph{synopsis} and the \strongemph{title}.  Are
the main findings, main recommendations and (if necessary) the purpose
and scope of the investigation clear from the synopsis?  Do the title
and synopsis form a unit?  Is the title short and informative?  See
Sections~\ref{sec:title} and~\ref{sec:synopsis-keywords}.

Is the report prepared with the necessary editorial care?  Note
neatness, balanced page layout, care of language, spelling errors,
integrity with respect to numbering, grammatical parallelism of
headings and lists, sentence and paragraph construction, reference
technique and the correct application of conventions with regard to
figure and table titles.  A trained editor will have noticed most of
these errors during the first reading of the report.

Does the report serve its \strongemph{purpose}?  Is the report
\strongemph{accurate}, \strongemph{brief} and \strongemph{clear}?  Is
the development logical?  Is the style acceptable?

It is strongly recommended that the report be read by a friend or
colleague for a final check on spelling errors and readability.

\section[Reference Methods: Policy of the Department of \\Chemical Engineering]{Reference methods: Policy of the \\Department of Chemical Engineering}
\label{app:reference_methods}
Two very popular reference methods are the Harvard method and the
augmented Harvard method.  Guidelines for the use of these methods are
contained in the International Standards Organisation (ISO) guideline
ISO 690 \citep{ISO690}.  \citet{burger} discusses these methods from
the perspective of a South African user.

In brief, the Harvard method quotes an author in the text by means of
a surname and the year of the publication, for example ``\dots was found.
(Smith, 1975)''.  The references are then given in alphabetical order
(according to the surname of the primary author) in the reference
list.  In the augmented Harvard method the text will contain a digit
which coincides with the position of the source in the reference list,
e.g. ``\dots was found.  [21]''.  The references are then given in
numerical order in the list of references.  Although the augmented
Harvard method is mostly used in scientific publications, we will, for
practical reasons, use the ordinary Harvard method in this department.

In practice a researcher/author will decide in which journal he/she
wishes to publish and will then adopt the reference style of that
journal.  Usually instructions/guidelines for authors appear at the
back of a journal, sometimes only in the December or January issue of
the journal.  Nevertheless, it is recommended that you scan the
journal for a paper with a decent list of references and use it as
your model.

\subsection{References in the text}

In the general case the following are placed in brackets at the point
of referencing in the text.

\paragraph{Books} Author's surname + comma + date of publication + colon +
page number e.g. (Smith, 1988: 45) or (Smith \& Jones, 1999: 126)

\paragraph{Journals} Author's surname + comma + date of publication e.g.
(Smith, 1988) or (Smith, Smith \& Jones, 2004).

Include initials if reference is made to more than one Smith e.g.
(Smith, RP, 1988).

Special cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the date of publication is not known, use the copyright year
  or (if this not known): \emph{sa} [= \emph{sine anno}, no year], e.g. (Smith,
  \emph{sa})
\item The page number is typically shown when reference is made to a
  certain place in the book and not when the whole book, an extract
  from a book or a journal article is referred to.
\item Two authors are linked with ``\&'' (Smith \& Klein, 1988).
\item Three authors -- first citation (Smith, Klein \& Long, 1988) and
  at later citings (Smith \emph{et al}, 1988); note there is no full
  stop before the comma.  ``\emph{Et al}'' is short for \emph{et alii},
  which means ``and others'' in Latin.  It is often translated as
  ``and coworkers'' when read in scientific context.
\item More than three authors are treated in the same way as later
  citations of three authors, e.g. (Smith \emph{et al}, 1988).
\item When the author is already mentioned in the text, the author's
  name is not repeated, e.g. ``Smith (1988) found that \dots'' or
  ``Smith \& Jones (1999) found that \dots'' or ``Nicol \emph{et al} (2004)
  claim that \dots''
\item More than one reference for the same statement: (Smith \& Klein,
  1988; Peters, 1989) or ``Smith \& Klein (1988) and Peters
  (1989) found that \dots''.
\item Institutions must be referred to with minimum identification
  (Department of Energy Affairs, 1978) or (CSIR, 1987: 34).
\item If the same author published more than one publication in the
  same year, the publications are taken up alphabetically according to
  the title and marked ``a, b, c, etc.'', e.g. (Smith, 1988a; Smith,
  1988b).
\item Secondary references, e.g. when the original reference is not
  available, are treated as follows: (Smith, quoted by Peters, 1989:
  45).
\item Unusual author surnames: (Van der Merwe \& Day-Lewis, 1990).
\item Information taken from an encyclopaedia is treated in the same
  way as a chapter or section in an edited book.  The encyclopaedia
  article usually has an author who is cited in the text.  An example
  of a reference entry for this case is given in~\ref{sec:referencelist}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A note on electronic documents}
With the common use of electronic resources and the Internet, it is
becoming more difficult to give a single reference for a physical
article.  There are several standards underway to provide a consistent
way of referring to on-line sources, but the URL (something like
\url{http://www.someaddress.com}) will not be connected with the same
information for any length of time.  For this reason, on-line sources
should be quoted only after exhaustive search for a physical reference
has yielded no results.  There are very few web sites that exist
totally removed from any physical media -- if you are referencing a
web site for important information, there is a good chance they have
referenced their sources and you would do well to consult the original
material.

If there is no way to avoid citing a web reference, ensure that you
quote the date on which you visited the URL.

If you have obtained information from the documentation of a computer
program, cite them using the publishing company and a full version
number for the software (see the examples on
page~\pageref{page:ref_compsoftware}).  Remember to use an author and date
if this information is known.  As usual, refrain from using references
to computer media that may not be available to everyone -- even if
``everyone'' is using the software now, it may not be available in
years to come.

\subsection{The reference list}
\label{sec:referencelist}

The cited references appear alphabetically in the reference list
according to the name of the first author.  Publications of the same
author are arranged chronologically and when author and year are the
same the sources are quoted alphabetically according to titles and
distinguished by alphabetical letters (e.g. 1988a, 1988b).

All the authors are mentioned.  (\emph{et al}  is never used in the
reference list).

Details of the publications are given in the following sequence:
author, year of publication and title; after that it depends on
whether the publication is a book, a journal or other work.  Most of
the options are indicated here as examples.  
Note that these groupings (Book, Paper, etc) should not appear in the reference list.

\paragraph{Book}
The book's title is in \emph{italics}.

\paragraph{Paper published in a journal}
The paper's title is in ``quotes'', while the journal name is in \emph{italics}.

\paragraph{Personal communication}
Never use personal communication references where a written reference
to the same information is available.  Never quote a lecturer on a
theoretical statement.  A reference should enable the reader to look
at your information.  Personal communications make this difficult.

Note: References to electronic media should be devised as author,
date, title as shown in the three examples above, even if
``Microsoft'' is not an author.

\subsubsection*{Important notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item The references are not numbered.  Paragraph spacing is used
  between references.
\item Volume numbers of journal articles are given in italics and the
  number of the issue (not in italics) follows in brackets.  Some
  journals indicate the issue or volume as a month and then the same
  rules apply.
\item In the titles of journal articles or extracts from books, only
  the first word is capitalised.  In the titles of books or
  conferences all the key words in the title are capitalised, e.g.
  \textit{Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer}.
\item The patents of Henis \& Tripodi above are arranged
  alphabetically according to title.  If the second author had been
  different, the patents would have been arranged according to the
  second author.
\item In the reference list ``and'' is used with more than one author,
  while the ``\&'' is used in the text reference.
\item An author's initials are separated from the surname by a comma,
  following the abbreviation rules in Section~\ref{sec:abbreviations}.
\item In the reference list it is common to give the first and last
  page numbers of a journal paper.
\item In the reference list the page numbers of a book are not
  mentioned -- they have already been given in the reference in the
  text.
\item When reference is made to a conference the year is shown between
  brackets after the author(s) and often repeated when the conference
  dates are given.
\end{itemize}

It must again be emphasised that these guidelines hold for this
Department and that a number of alternative referencing systems are in
use.  A practical advantage of the Harvard method is that the
elimination and addition of references is done without it being
necessary to renumber all the references.  It is also often easier for
the reader if the referenced author is mentioned by name in the text,
instead of being identified as a number only.

\section{Computer specific problems}
\label{app:computerproblems}
\subsection{Computer notation}
\label{sec:compnotation}

As computers become more prevalent it is tempting to use notation that
is useful on the computer in technical writing.  Make sure that you do
not use one of the incorrect forms listed in Table~\ref{tab:compnotation}
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Common computer notation errors}
  \label{tab:compnotation}
  \begin{centering}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
      \toprule
      Incorrect & Improvement & Problem point \\
      \midrule
      1123.232e6 & \num{1123.123e6} & 1 \\
      \verb|a*b^c/2| & $\frac{a \times b^c}{2}$ or $a\cdot b^c / 2$ &
      2,3 \\
      lambda*4 & $4\lambda$ & 2,4 \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}\\
  \end{centering}
\end{table}

Do not use:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \verb|e| to denote scientific notation.  Rather use
  \num{10.2e2}.
\item \verb|a*b| for multiplication in an equation. Rather use
$a \cdot b$, $a \times b $ or implied multiplication ($ab$).
\item \verb|a^b| for exponentiation.  Rather use $a^b$.
\item written out versions of Greek letters (like lambda).  Rather use
  the correct character ($\lambda$).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Graphic file formats}
When graphics are stored on a computer, there are two different
approaches that can be taken.  We can store information about
\begin{itemize}
\item each pixel (picture element) in the image or
\item the objects that make up the image (lines, arcs, blocks, etc).
\end{itemize}

An image described using the pixel approach is termed a \emph{raster}
graphic, while images described using the second approach are called
\emph{vector} graphics.

The difference between raster and vector graphics can easily be seen
when enlarging or zooming in on an image as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:rastervector}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\linewidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5cm]{rasdemo}    
    \includegraphics[width=1cm]{rasdemo}
    \includegraphics[width=2cm]{rasdemo}
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{rasdemo}\\
    Raster
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}{0.4\linewidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5cm]{vecdemo}
    \includegraphics[width=1cm]{vecdemo}
    \includegraphics[width=2cm]{vecdemo}
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{vecdemo}\\
    Vector
  \end{minipage}  
  \caption{Difference between raster and vector graphics}
  \label{fig:rastervector}
\end{figure}

Most of the graphics in an engineering report will be well represented
using vector graphics.  They work well for plots, graphs and line
drawings of equipment.  They result in small file sizes and produce
high quality output when printed.  Examples of file extensions for
vector files are EPS, WMF, EMF and Visio files.  Raster graphics will
probably be used exclusively for photographs or screen captures of
computer software.  Examples of file extensions for raster files are
BMP, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and JPG.

When preparing screen captures, another important aspect of the graphic
file format is the type of compression used.  Most common raster file
formats are \emph{lossless}, retaining all of the information in the
original file.  The JPG file format, however, was designed to compress
photographs and uses \emph{lossy} compression based on mathematical
reduction of the information in the original file.  The effect of this
compression can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:jpgexample}, where a
screenshot was taken and saved as a PNG file and a JPG file.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{screenshot_lossless}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{screenshot_lossy}
  \caption{Lossless compression (PNG) vs lossy compression (JPG).
    Note the noise or ``artifacts'' in the second image}
  \label{fig:jpgexample}
\end{figure}

The routines used to compress the image in JPG are optimised for photographs and should only be used for images with ``natural''
characteristics, rather than computer generated images.

Most students will incorporate graphics into a word-processor using ``copy and paste''.
This may cause the format of the file to be unknown.
It is recommended that all graphics be saved as separate files and then inserted into the document.
This will not only ensure that the document retains a manageable size, but will make it easier to exchange graphics as well.

\subsection{Equations}
\label{sec:tips-equations}
To insert an equation according to our guidelines in Word 2003 you can follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Insert a 1$\times$3 table in Word, and make the column width of column 1 and 3 15\%.
\item Next insert an equation in the middle column. Don't enter an equation.
\item Place the cursor to the right of the equation in the middle column.
\item Go to References | Insert Caption in the menu. Select ``Equation'' next to label and select the ``Exclude label from caption'' checkbox. See figure~\ref{fig:wordcaption}
\item Move the caption to the third column and surround it in parentheses.
\item Remove the borders from the table
\item Select the whole table
\item Save the equation to the gallery by selecting ``Insert|Equation|Save Selection to Equation Gallery.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{captionwindow}
  \caption{The Insert Caption window in Word 2003}
  \label{fig:wordcaption}
\end{figure}
Now you can insert this equation into a document using this building block.
You can cross-reference this equation by going to ``References|Cross reference'' and selecting the ``Equation'' reference type. 
You will see the window shown in figure~\ref{fig:wordcrossref}. 
You can then select the equation from the list. 
It will be kept up to date automatically.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{crossreference}
  \caption{The Cross-reference window in Word 2003}
  \label{fig:wordcrossref}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Special characters}
There are a number of special characters which are commonly mistyped or incorrectly entered.
Never resort to using a different font like Symbol to enter your special symbols.
Rather use the Unicode code point for the character you are looking for.
Table~\ref{tab:specialchar} shows a number of common symbols.
On MS Windows, these characters can be entered by holding the Alt key and then entering the code point including the leading zero.
For example, to enter the multiplication sign, press and hold Alt while entering 00D7, then let go of the Alt key.
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lcll}
    \toprule
    Name                                                                                                  & Symbol               & Code point & Name                \\

\subsection{Formatting}
\label{sec:tips-formatting}
There are often problems with line breaks when certain words need to
be kept together.  A common example is a number and its unit or the
number \num{1.2e4}.  It is bad form for such elements to be broken at
the end of a line.  The solution to this problem is the
\emph{non-breaking space}.  In Microsoft Word, a non-breaking space is
inserted by pressing Ctrl-Shift-Space.  In \LaTeX, use \verb|~|.

% \section{Grammatical errors}
% \label{app:grammatical-errors}

% Some common grammatical errors should be avoided assiduously:

% \begin{description}
% \item[Split infinitives] The infinitive form of a verb is the
%   structure ``to \emph{verb}''.  These two words should be seen as a
%   unit and should not be split with adverbs as in ``to easily do''.
%   Rather use ``to do easily''.  See
%   \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_infinitive}.
% \item[Dangling participle] Ensure that modifiers (especially
%   participles) attach clearly to the words they are modifying.  A
%   common example of incorrect usage is ``Substituting Equation 1 into
%   Equation 2 gives \dots''.  The following two examples are gramatically
%   sound: ``Substitution of Equation 1 into Equation 2 gives \dots''
%   and ``By substituting Equation 1 in Equation 2, we obtain \dots''.
%   See~\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_modifier}.
% \end{description}

\section{Font and Spacing}
\label{sec:app-font-spacing}
%The minimum font size, line size and paragraph spacing are indicated
%in true size on the next page.  Compare your text to these samples.

The minimum font x height is \SI{2}{mm}.  
The minimum line spacing and paragraph spacing (baseline to baseline) for body text are \SI{8}{mm} and \SI{16}{mm} respectively, as indicated below.  
These sizes correspond approximately to 1.5 line spacing with a font
size between 12 and 14 printer's points for most typefaces.  
Be sure to check a printout of your chosen typeface before submission.
